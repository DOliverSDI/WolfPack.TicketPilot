    ## Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics 4 - Issue Resolution Report

    **Date of Interaction:** 2024-07-27
    **Initial Request:** We aren't seeing our tag fire on Google Tag Manager

    **Executive Summary:** The initial issue of the tag failing to fire has been resolved. However, a secondary concern regarding user privacy and the tag's firing behavior in light of consent management practices has been raised.

    **Timeline of Events:**

    * **2024-07-27:** Initial report of the tag not firing.
    * **2024-08-15:** Investigation revealed the tag lacked the correct trigger configuration.
    * **2024-08-20:** Trigger was updated, successfully restoring tag firing.
    * **2024-08-26:** Discussion regarding privacy implications of the tag firing when user consent is denied.  A recommendation to explore integration with a Consent Management tool was provided.

    **Current Status:** The tag is now firing, but potential privacy concerns require further attention.

    **Recommendations:**

    *   **Implement a Consent Management Tool:** Integrating a Consent Management Platform (CMP) will allow the tag to respect user choices and only fire when consent is granted.
    *   **Review Tag Trigger Logic:**  Ensure the trigger logic is designed to gracefully handle denied consent, potentially by excluding users who haven't consented.
    *   **Monitor Tag Firing:**  Continuously monitor tag firing to ensure it aligns with privacy policies and user consent.

    ### Possible Next Steps:

    1.  **Research and Select a CMP:** Evaluate different Consent Management Platforms (e.g., Cookiebot, OneTrust, Usercentrics) based on budget, features, and integration requirements.
    2.  **Integrate the CMP with GTM:** Follow the CMP's documentation to implement the necessary integrations within Google Tag Manager.
    3.  **Test and Validate:** Thoroughly test the integrated solution to confirm that the tag fires only when consent is provided and that user privacy is respected.
