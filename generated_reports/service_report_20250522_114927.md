## Report: Ticket 1234123 - Data Loss and Consent Management

    **Date:** 2025-05-22
    **Ticket ID:** 1234123
    **Subject:** Data Loss and Consent Management Recommendations

    **Summary:** The customer experienced a period of data loss due to a misconfigured tag trigger. While the tag is now firing again, the lost data cannot be recovered.  The customer also expressed interest in implementing a Consent Management Tool (CMT) for future tagging practices.

    **Issue:** The primary issue was a trigger configuration error within Google Tag Manager, leading to the tag failing to fire and consequently, a loss of data.  Specifically, the trigger was not set to activate at the relevant event.

    **Resolution:** The tag is now firing again, indicating the trigger has been corrected.

    **Lost Data:** Unfortunately, the lost data for the period of the outage cannot be recovered.

    **Recommendation:** The customer should consider implementing a Consent Management Tool (CMT) to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and to manage user consent for data collection.  I can provide recommendations for suitable CMT solutions based on their specific needs and website traffic.

    **Possible Next Steps:**

    1.  **CMT Research & Demo:**  Schedule a follow-up session to discuss and demo potential CMT solutions.  This will involve understanding the customer's website structure, traffic volume, and specific consent requirements.
    2.  **Tag Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of all Google Tag Manager tags to identify and rectify any other potential trigger configuration errors. This proactive step will help prevent future data loss incidents.
    3.  **Documentation & Training:**  Provide the customer with clear documentation on the corrected tag configuration and best practices for managing Google Tag Manager tags, including the importance of regularly reviewing and testing triggers.
