**Possible Next Steps:**

1.  **Deep Dive into Privacy Compliance:** Schedule a follow-up session to discuss specific privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and how they apply to the client's data collection practices.  This includes exploring options like consent management platforms (CMPs) and data anonymization techniques.
2.  **GTM Configuration Review for Privacy:**  Review the existing GTM configuration to identify potential privacy risks, such as tracking data unnecessarily or collecting data without proper consent.  This should include examining triggers, variables, and tags.
