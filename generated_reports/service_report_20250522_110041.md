**Report:**

**Ticket ID:** 493485
**Date of Interaction:** 2025-05-22
**Subject:** Data Loss - Tag Inactivity

**Summary:**

On 2025-05-22, the client reported that a specific tag was no longer firing. Initial investigation revealed that the tag had ceased to fire for approximately one month.  Despite successfully resolving the firing issue, the client was informed that data collected during the period of inactivity cannot be recovered.

**Analysis:**

The client experienced a period of data loss due to the tag's failure to fire. While the immediate technical issue has been addressed, the lost data represents a significant impact.  This highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and alerting for tag performance.  Google Analytics 4 (GA4) does not offer retroactive data recovery for events that have not been recorded.

**Resolution:**

The tag has been confirmed to be firing correctly as of the current date. However, data from the month-long period of inactivity is permanently lost.

**Possible Next Steps:**

1.  **Implement Enhanced Tag Monitoring:**  Set up automated alerts within Google Tag Manager and GA4 to immediately notify the team of any tag firing issues. This will prevent similar data loss incidents in the future.
2.  **Review Tag Triggering Logic:**  Examine the tag's trigger conditions within GTM to ensure they are still relevant and accurately reflecting user behavior. A change in website design or user flows could have inadvertently disabled the trigger.
3.  **Data Backup Strategy (Considerations):** While GA4 doesn't offer retroactive data recovery, explore options for backing up raw event data from Google Tag Manager.  This could involve exporting the GTM data stream to a data warehouse or cloud storage for potential future analysis or reconstruction.
