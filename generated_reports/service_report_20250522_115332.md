## Report: Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics 4 - Ticket 1234123

    **Date:** 2025-05-22
    **Ticket ID:** 1234123
    **Subject:** Data Loss & Consent Management Tool Recommendation

    **Summary:** The client experienced a period of data loss due to a misconfigured tag trigger in Google Tag Manager. While the tag is now firing again, the lost data cannot be recovered.  The client is also interested in implementing a Consent Management Tool (CMT) to ensure future compliance and regulate tagging practices.

    **Key Findings:**

    *   **Data Loss:** A trigger within the Google Tag Manager tag was inadvertently deactivated, leading to a cessation of data collection for approximately one month. This data is unrecoverable.
    *   **Tag Functionality:** The Google Tag Manager tag is currently firing again, indicating the trigger has been restored.
    *   **Consent Management:** The client is proactively seeking a solution for managing user consent and regulating tagging practices, demonstrating a commitment to data privacy and compliance.

    **Recommendation:**  Focus on implementing a Consent Management Tool (CMT) to prevent similar data loss incidents in the future and to ensure ongoing compliance with data privacy regulations.
