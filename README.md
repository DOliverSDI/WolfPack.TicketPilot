# TicketPilot - AI-Powered Support Documentation Generator

## Project Overview

TicketPilot is an innovative AI project designed to transform complex support tickets into clear, easily understandable documentation for end users. This project leverages advanced AI models to bridge the gap between technical support interactions and accessible user documentation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of TicketPilot is to automatically generate comprehensive documentation from support tickets and chat logs, making technical solutions accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. By processing support interactions, the system creates documentation that anyone can understand and use to resolve similar issues.

## Project Architecture

### Part 1: Information Mediator (Gemma 3 Model)
The first component utilizes a Gemma 3 model that serves as an Information Mediator. This AI system:
- Analyzes initial support ticket inputs
- Processes chat logs and support interactions
- Generates clear, structured support documentation
- Translates technical jargon into user-friendly language

*Note: This component is currently under development.*

### Part 2: Interactive Documentation Assistant (Vertex AI)
The second component leverages Vertex AI to create an interactive experience:
- Connects to the documentation generated by the Gemma 3 model
- Acts as an intelligent chatbot for end users
- Answers questions about specific documents
- Provides assistance across related documentation

*Note: This component is currently under development.*
