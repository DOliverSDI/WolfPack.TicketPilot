# TicketPilot - AI-Powered Support Documentation Generator

## Project Overview

TicketPilot is an innovative AI project designed to transform complex support tickets into clear, easily understandable documentation for end users. This project leverages advanced AI models to bridge the gap between technical support interactions and accessible user documentation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of TicketPilot is to automatically generate comprehensive documentation from support tickets and chat logs, making technical solutions accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. By processing support interactions, the system creates documentation that anyone can understand and use to resolve similar issues.

## How to run

It might be difficult to get it up and running. We had used poetry as our dependency manager. If you have our project downloaded in code editor like vscode that has access to a terminal, here are some steps to possibly get the app working.
-  If you have poetry installed, you can clone our repository and run run 'poetry install --no-root' to download our dependencies.
-  make sure you are running python version 3.13 or above
-  We are using hugging face transformers so it may ask for a User Access Token in order to run. If needed, let us know and we can see if we can resolve it

### If after running app.py that the program does not give you any errors, you can click on the flask ip address to view the local site

## Project Architecture

### Part 1: Information Mediator (Gemma 3 Model)
The first component utilizes a Gemma 3 model that serves as an Information Mediator. This AI system:
- Analyzes initial support ticket inputs
- Processes chat logs and support interactions
- Generates clear, structured support documentation
- Translates technical jargon into user-friendly language

*Note: This component is currently under development.*

### Part 2: Interactive Documentation Assistant (Vertex AI)
The second component leverages Vertex AI to create an interactive experience:
- Connects to the documentation generated by the Gemma 3 model
- Acts as an intelligent chatbot for end users
- Answers questions about specific documents
- Provides assistance across related documentation

*Note: This component is currently under development.*

## Vertex AI Integration

## Current Status

Both components of the project are currently in development. The system aims to create a seamless workflow from support ticket ingestion to interactive user assistance.

## Features (Planned)

- Automatic support ticket analysis
- Chat log processing and summarization
- User-friendly documentation generation
- Interactive Q&A capabilities
- Cross-document knowledge retrieval
- Scalable AI-powered support automation

## Technology Stack

- **Gemma 3 Model**: Information processing and documentation generation
- **Vertex AI**: Interactive chatbot and query processing
- **Python**: Primary development language
